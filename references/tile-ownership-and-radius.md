Everything here was extracted from the **installed base-game code** (not docs), plus
the Civ6 "Neighborhood Tall Extension" mod source. Trust it over wiki/forum claims,
which are stale or wrong on this topic.

## 1. The native cross-city "swap" IS real (wiki says otherwise — it's wrong)

A settlement's **Expand / place-population picker** can reassign a tile that is
**already owned by another of YOUR settlements** into the picking city's borders.
In-game this looks like: the orange "claimable" ring includes a tile whose tooltip
still names a different city of yours; picking it transfers ownership.

- This is NOT Civ6-style gold tile purchase, and NOT permanent-ownership.
- The claimable plot set comes from the **native engine**:
  `Game.CityCommands.canStart(cityID, CityCommandTypes.EXPAND, {}, false)` →
  `result.Plots`. See `base-standard/ui/place-population/model-place-population.js`
  (`updateExpandPlots`). The JS only *renders* `result.Plots`; it does not decide
  them.
- Implication for modders: the eligibility rule (which owned tiles can be pulled,
  and the distance) lives in compiled C++. **You cannot change it from XML or JS.**

## 2. The "3-hex limit" is an EXPANSION cap, NOT a working cap (corrected 2026-06-30; ⚠ RE-CORRECTED 2026-07-03)

> **Controlled FireTuner matrix (4 tiles) — the definitive model:**
> `city.Growth.claimPlot({x,y})` is the engine's **full expansion primitive**, not a bare
> ownership flip. Each call: claims the tile + attaches it to the city as **Rural** +
> **auto-places the terrain-appropriate improvement** (vegetated→Woodcutter,
> mountain→Expedition Base, resource→its real improvement e.g. Plantation, coastal
> water→Fishing Boat) + the city collects the full tile yields **same turn**, including
> all mod plot-modifiers, which apply the moment the tile is owned. Resources join the
> city pool; one claim even minted +1 rural population. Works at **distance 4 AND 5,
> non-contiguously (across unowned gaps), and on water**. City yield delta matched the
> tile tooltip total exactly on all 4 test tiles.
>
> **Unified model reconciling every prior test:** ownership alone ≠ yields (the WASET
> "dead" tile was grabbed by CLAIM_RESOURCE's territory side-effect and never
> auto-improved); an **improved** rural tile pays at any distance; the range-3 cap only
> blocks **player-driven** improving/pop-placement. So "empty outer tiles are a dead
> end" (section 5) is wrong for claimPlot-claimed tiles — they self-improve. The delivery wall
> (gameplay isolate unreachable by mods, section 4a) is UNCHANGED on 1.4.1 and is the only
> thing keeping this out of a shippable mod; it works fully in FireTuner and scenarios.

⚠ **Reframed by in-game testing** — the original "work radius is 3" reading was
imprecise. The truth:
- The **3-hex limit caps natural border EXPANSION/acquisition** — the `EXPAND` picker
  (`Game.CityCommands.canStart(...EXPAND)`), growth events, and leapfrogging all
  refuse to hand out tiles past distance 3.
- It is **NOT a cap on WORKING tiles.** Once a city *owns* a tile by any means, the
  engine assigns citizens and collects its yields normally **at any distance**.
- **PROVEN 2026-06-30 (FireTuner):** `city.Growth.claimPlot({x,y})` grants ownership
  below the expansion cap (claimed **dist-4** tiles); Madrid's per-turn yields then
  **rose with each claim, same turn, no turn passing** (Food 8→10, Prod 10→13, Gold
  7→8.7, Sci 0→1, Cult 8→12, Happy 14→16 over 4 dist-4 claims). The engine works
  owned ring-4 tiles natively.
- **Consequence:** a Civ7 3→5 mod needs ONLY to *claim* ring-4/5 tiles for tall
  cities — **no yield injection, no dummy specialists** (unlike the Civ6 mod, whose
  *working* layer WAS radius-capped, section 4). Dramatically lighter than Civ6.
- **SHIPPABLE as a data-only feature (a "Surveyor"-style claim unit):** the
  general claimPlot route needs a gameplay-script isolate mods can't reach, but the base
  Prospector **`UNITCOMMAND_CLAIM_RESOURCE`** claims a **resource** tile ≤5 hexes into your
  borders with pure data — port that ability chain onto a buildable civilian and you have a
  tall "reach" unit. Resource tiles only; empty ring-4/5 tiles stay unworkable (3-hex work
  radius holds). Full build recipe — the ability-chain port, charges, icons, visuals, AI —
  in [custom-units.md](custom-units.md).

The original notes below remain true for *natural* expansion:
- A settlement only ever **naturally expands to** tiles within **3 hexes** of its City Center.
- **There is NO GlobalParameter for it.** Grepping every module under
  `Base/modules/**/data` for `name="..._RADIUS/RANGE/EXPAND/EXPANSION..." value="N"`
  yields nothing for city work range. The only radius-ish strings are diplomacy
  land-claim args (`CityRadius`, `CapitalRadius` in `diplomacy-gameeffects.xml`).
- The game binaries contain only `CityRadius` (the diplomacy arg) — no
  `CityWorkRange` / `ExpansionRadius` / `WorkableRadius` tunable.
- There is **no `EFFECT_*` to widen the radius** ("grant extra space/extent" does
  not exist). Confirmed engine-side and not data-exposed.

So: a Civ6-style "just bump the work range to 5" mod is **impossible** via the
database/GameEffects layer in Civ7.

## 3. The only data-driven claim system is diplomacy land-claim (different thing)

`EFFECT_START_LAND_CLAIM` / `EFFECT_COMPLETE_LAND_CLAIM`, driven by
`LAND_CLAIM_RANGE_PER_STEP="2"` and `LAND_CLAIM_STEPS="1"`
(`base-standard/data/diplomacy-actions.xml`). These are `Replace`-able params and
real attachable effects — but they govern claiming **another civilization's** tiles
via a diplomatic action, not extending your own city's reach. Not a radius lever.

## 4. How Civ6 actually did 3→5 (and what a Civ7 port would need)

The Civ6 mod **Cyp "Wide and Tall"** (Steam workshop `2706527619`,
`Scripts/CypWt_Script_NeighborhoodTe.lua`) did **NOT** change the engine work
radius. It **simulated** rings 4–5 entirely in Lua:

1. **Real ownership of ring 4–5 plots** via `WorldBuilder.CityManager():SetPlotOwner(x,y,player,city)`,
   gated to `iDistance >= 4 and <= 5` (`CypWtNbhTeSwapTile`, `CypWtNbhTePurchasePlot`).
2. **Picked which outer tiles to "work"** by population + plot score across rings 1–5
   (`CypWtNbhTeDetermineAutoAssignedOuterRingWorkers`).
3. **Injected the would-be yields onto the City Center plot** via plot Properties
   (binary-encoded), minus a "specialist compensation" malus so it nets correctly.
4. **Consumed real population** by creating dummy specialist buildings
   (`BUILDING_CYP_WT_POPULATION_WORKERS_n`, binary-encoded count) so the fake
   working actually costs pop.
5. **Recomputed on events** — `Events.PlotYieldChanged / CityWorkerChanged /
   CityTileOwnershipChanged / CityFocusChanged` + custom `GameEvents.CypWt_CC_*`.

It was a scripted illusion layered on the engine, not a radius change. (This is the
"very experimental, not really in the codebase" approach.)

### Civ7 port feasibility — UPGRADED 2026-06-30: all the scripting primitives EXIST

Researched against the **Civ VII Development Tools** (the modding SDK; installed at
`steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization VII Development Tools/` — `Reference/`
holds de-obfuscated base `.ts` source, `Documentation/` the official modinfo docs,
`FireTuner/` the live console). Every Civ6 primitive has a Civ7 equivalent:

1. **Gameplay-context script vehicle = modinfo `<ScenarioScripts>` action.** Docs
   (`Documentation/modinfo Files.md`): "Adds a new `.js` gameplay script." This is a
   **persistent gameplay-context** script — distinct from `<MapGenScripts>` (loaded
   during map gen then unloaded) and `<UIScripts>` (UI context, read-mostly). It runs
   where state can be MUTATED. The base game's own gameplay scripts
   (`scripts/age-transition-post-load.js`, `maps/map-utilities.js`) run in this
   context and freely mutate: claim plots, regress cities to towns, cap gold, place
   units. (No base *modinfo* uses `ScenarioScripts` — base gameplay scripts load via
   the age/map system — but the action type is documented and supported for mods.)
2. **Plot-ownership API (no WorldBuilder needed) = `city.Growth.claimPlot({x,y})`.**
   A real runtime method on the City Growth component, used by base map code
   (`map-utilities.js:449` `placeRuralDistrict` → `city.Growth?.claimPlot(...)`). This
   is the clean legitimate path and BETTER than the WorldBuilder route. ⚠ It is
   **undocumented in the public typings** (no `.d.ts` signature; present in the engine
   only) — so behaviour must be confirmed live. `WorldBuilder.MapPlots.setOwnership`
   (`tuner-input.js`) remains a fallback.
3. **Live event hooks = `engine.on(...)`** — confirmed present:
   `PlayerTurnActivated`, `PlayerTurnDeactivated`, `CityAddedToMap`,
   `CityInitialized`, `CityProductionChanged`, **`PlotOwnershipChanged`**. Direct
   equivalents of the Civ6 `Events.*` the NBH-TE mod hooked.
4. **FireTuner** (in the Dev Tools) = live JS/console to TEST the API before building.

**✅ CONFIRMED IN-GAME 2026-06-30 (FireTuner):** `claimPlot` does NOT enforce the
3-hex cap. Called `city.Growth.claimPlot({x,y})` on **distance-4** tiles in a live
1.4.1 game (Tuner context); ownership flipped — `GameplayMap.getOwner` returned the
human player (pid 0) for tiles at dist 4 from the city center (e.g. city (38,11) →
owned (36,7),(37,7), both dist 4), and the map border visibly recolored. **The
3-hex radius wall IS breakable from a gameplay script via `claimPlot`.** This was the
make-or-break question — answered YES.

FireTuner notes for re-testing: context dropdown = **Tuner** (the gameplay sim VM;
`GameContext` is UI-only and is `not defined` here — find the human player by scanning
`Players.get(i).isHuman`). `console.log` in the Tuner context goes to the game log, NOT
the FireTuner panel — the panel only prints the **return value**, so `return
JSON.stringify(...)` to see output. Confirmed live APIs: `Players.get(i)` (.isAlive/
.isHuman/.isMajor), `player.Cities.getCities()`→City[], `city.location.{x,y}`,
`city.Growth.claimPlot({x,y})`, `GameplayMap.getPlotDistance/getOwner/getGridWidth/
getGridHeight`, `MapCities.getCity(x,y)`, `city.Workers.getNumWorkers()/getCityWorkerCap()`.
**Yields:** use the **plot-INDEX** form `GameplayMap.getYields(GameplayMap.getIndexFromXY(x,y), pid)`
→ returns `[[yieldTypeHash, amount], …]`; the `{x,y}`-location form returns `[]` (wrong
overload). ⚠ `GameplayMap.getYieldsWithCity(loc, cityID)` exists but **CALLING it in the
Tuner context returned nothing / aborted the script** (likely a native fault on arg shape)
— avoid for now. Also CONFIRMED: `MapCities.getCity(x,y)` on a claimed dist-4 tile returns
the human's city ComponentID (`{owner,id,type}`) → **the engine attaches dist-4 territory
to the city**, not just the player.

**✅ Second test ALSO CONFIRMED 2026-06-30:** the owned ring-4 tiles **DO get worked
natively** — claiming yielding dist-4 tiles raised the city's per-turn yields with each
claim (see section 2). So **NO yield injection / dummy specialists are needed** — the Civ6
faking layer does not need to port at all. The mod is just: claim ring-4/5 tiles for
tall cities; the engine works them.

**UI vs gameplay context (tested 2026-06-30):** `city.Growth.claimPlot` is present in
BOTH contexts (`typeof === function`) but is a **NO-OP in the UI ("App UI") context** —
called it there on an unowned dist-4 tile, no error, ownership stayed `-1`. It only
mutates in the **gameplay (Tuner)** context. There is **no custom UI→gameplay RPC for
mods**: `engine.trigger` is within-context only; the cross-context channels
(`Game.{City,Player,Unit}Operations/Commands.sendRequest`, `engine.call`) are native
and not mod-extensible; all 3 SDK example mods are pure data mods. **Implication for an
INTERACTIVE "player picks a tile" UX:** you can't wire a custom UI plot-picker straight
to `claimPlot`. The reachable interactive route is a **native channel the gameplay
script can OBSERVE** — i.e. a unit/commander **UnitCommand** (native UI→gameplay) whose
unit event the `<ScenarioScripts>` catches and then calls `claimPlot` (a "claim/annex
agent" you move onto the ring-4/5 tile — which also matches the original in-game
observation that started this). AUTO (pop-gated, claim on a growth/turn `engine.on`
event) needs no UI bridge at all and is the lightest path. The plot-picker UI itself is
cloneable from `interface-mode-diplo-claim-plot.ts` (uses `ChoosePlotInterfaceMode`,
`commitPlot`→`Game.PlayerOperations.sendRequest`), but `sendRequest` only routes NATIVE
ops so the picker alone can't claim.

**⚠️ VERDICT (REVISED 2026-06-30): the SCRIPT delivery path is blocked, but a NATIVE/DATA
claim path is UNTESTED and OPEN — do not call the feature dead.** (Premature "not shippable"
conclusion corrected after user pushback.) Two ways to trigger an engine claim: (a) a
custom gameplay JS script calling `claimPlot` — BLOCKED (below); (b) a NATIVE engine action
(unit ability/command, player operation, or effect) triggered purely by DATA — runs in the
engine, ships in normal games, NOT yet tested. The Prospector proves (b) exists.

**Path (b) — native/data claim candidates:**
- **`PlayerOperationTypes.LAND_CLAIM` — ❌ TESTED 2026-07-03: DORMANT/CUT CONTENT on 1.4.1.**
  `Game.PlayerOperations.canStart(pid, PlayerOperationTypes.LAND_CLAIM, {Type:
  GameInfo.DiplomacyActions.lookup("DIPLOMACY_ACTION_LAND_CLAIM").$index, X, Y}, false)`
  returns `{Success:false}` (no reason field) for EVERY tile — unowned ring-4/5, own city
  center, and with a Settler (UNIT_CLASS_CREATE_TOWN) standing ON the target. Corroborating:
  base-wide grep shows LAND_CLAIM referenced in exactly ONE UI file
  (`interface-mode-diplo-claim-plot.js`) and nothing ever switches to
  `INTERFACEMODE_DIPLO_CLAIM_PLOT` — the entry point was cut. The data rows (range
  GlobalParameters `LAND_CLAIM_RANGE_PER_STEP=2`/`STEPS=1` as `<Replace>` rows, effects,
  unit tags, grievance event) are all live but the native operation refuses to start.
  Re-probe after each patch in case Firaxis revives it.
- **Prospector `UNITCOMMAND_CLAIM_RESOURCE`** — native resource-claim (MO, resource-gated).
- Native effects seen: `EFFECT_START_LAND_CLAIM`/`EFFECT_COMPLETE_LAND_CLAIM`,
  `EFFECT_GRANT_SUZERAIN_UNIT_PLOT`, `EFFECT_PLAYER_GRANT_UNIT_AT_PLOT` (no general
  "grant-plot-to-city" effect found, but COMPLETE_LAND_CLAIM is the closest lever).

NEXT TEST (FireTuner, App UI isolate): `Game.PlayerOperations.canStart(pid, LAND_CLAIM,
{Type, X, Y})` on a ring-4 unowned tile → does the native claim accept it (Success=true)?

---
**Path (a) — the BLOCKED script route** (`claimPlot` mutates only in the gameplay/simulation
V8 isolate, which a mod CANNOT inject into for a normal game):
- **In-game test FAILED (Phase 1):** a `<ScenarioScripts>` gameplay JS NEVER EXECUTED in a
  normal AQ single-player game. The action group registered (Modding.log `* aq-claim-agent`)
  but the script's top-level `console.log` appeared in NO log — `Scripting.log` (which DOES
  capture all gameplay/map-script output; it was full of this game's map-gen) and
  `GameCore.log` both had zero `[claim-agent]` lines. The file was never evaluated.
- **Community-confirmed** (CivFanatics "Execution Model" + "Scripting Runtime Information"
  threads): Civ7 runs separate V8 isolates (Tuner, App UI, gameplay, map); the **gameplay
  isolate is not exposed to mods** — "gameplay scripts don't seem to be possible at this
  time." `<ScenarioScripts>` runs only in actual **scenario** games (no base/DLC modinfo uses
  it). The ONLY persistent mod JS in a normal game is `<UIScripts>` (App UI isolate), which
  **can't mutate gameplay** (claimPlot no-op there, tested) and risks MP desync.
- **No data path either:** there is no XML/SQL `EFFECT_*` to claim tiles or widen radius (sections 2-3).

So the gameplay isolate is reachable only by **FireTuner** (external debug tool) or **scenario
scripts** — neither is a shippable normal-game mod. **REALISTIC OPTIONS:** (a) SHELF until
Firaxis exposes gameplay scripting (community expects it may come); (b) ship as a custom
**SCENARIO** (ScenarioScripts works there) — but that's a load-a-scenario UX, not a normal
normal game; (c) stay **data-only/intensity** (the shipped model). The proven
research (claimPlot ignores the radius + engine works ring-4/5 tiles) is preserved for if/when
the gameplay isolate opens up or for scenario use.

**(Historical design sketch, if delivery ever unblocks:** a `<ScenarioScripts>` script gated to
the tall condition claims eligible ring-4/5 plots on a unit/growth event via `claimPlot`;
player-pick via a Prospector-style "claim agent" unit; ring 4+5; claimable = unowned +
own-empire only; pop-gate/cap for balance; cache + incremental.)

## 5. The SHIPPABLE feature it became — "Tall Resource Reach" (the Surveyor)

Since general tile-extension is unshippable (above), the realistic shippable feature uses the ONE
native claim that works — the Prospector's resource claim — deployed for tall players:

- **Native claim that works:** `UNITCOMMAND_CLAIM_RESOURCE` (Prospector's `ABILITY_CLAIM_RESOURCE`).
  Claims a **resource** tile **within 5 hexes of a friendly settlement** and **brings it into your
  territory** (confirmed in play + an Explorer test). Resource-gating is NATIVE (the command row
  is bare `Type`+`Kind`; no data requirement to drop) → resource tiles only.
- **Ability transfers to ANY unit** via a `TypeTags` row tagging it `UNIT_CLASS_PROSPECTOR` (PROVEN:
  Explorer test, Modern). The unit→command link is automatic through the charged ability (the
  `units.xml` UnitType+Command row is just an `AIUnitPrioritizedActions` AI hint, not the grant).
- **Empty claimed tiles stay inert:** ⛔ **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-15 — see the box at the top.** What is
  still true: a per-type `EFFECT_PLOT_ADJUST_YIELD` on an unworked RURAL tile is never collected, and
  **no "yield per owned tile/terrain" effect exists**. What was wrong: the conclusion that outer tiles
  can therefore never pay. Give the tile an **urban** district and a **building** (via `CREATE_ELEMENT`)
  and the city banks it with no citizen at all; a specialist can then be placed there through the normal
  UI. The dead end was `DISTRICT_RURAL` specifically — the only district class not marked
  `Workable="true"`.
- **Grant a unit (with an ability):** `EFFECT_CITY_GRANT_UNIT` (arg `UnitType`) grants a unit to a city;
  `EFFECT_GRANT_UNIT_OF_CLASS_AND_APPLY_ABILITY` grants a unit AND applies an ability (Great-Person
  grants use it, `run-once`, node-gated). Charge supply: `EFFECT_GRANT_UNIT_ABILITY_CHARGE`
  (`COLLECTION_OWNER`, recharge timer).
- **NO per-growth-event trigger exists** (verified — only one hardcoded yield-on-growth effect). Unit
  grants are milestone/`run-once`/node-based → tie grants to **population milestones**, not
  every growth. Building can't cost a literal pop (Migrant is `CanTrain="false"` + no "on unit trained"
  trigger to fire `EFFECT_CITY_ADJUST_POPULATION`); cost levers = production + `PrereqPopulation` + cooldown.
- **Payoff:** amplify each claimed resource for the tall city via `EFFECT_CITY_ADJUST_YIELD_PER_RESOURCE`
  / `…_PER_SLOTTED_RESOURCE` / `…_PER_RESOURCE_CLASS` (the engine has a whole per-resource family).

**Design (decided):** a DEDICATED tall-gated "Surveyor" unit (not tagging base Migrants), granted at
population milestones, carrying the claim charge, + a per-resource amplifier. **Implementation
shape:** the complete AQ/EX ability-chain wiring is a per-age effects file (unit + UNIT_CLASS_PROSPECTOR
tag + ABILITY_CLAIM_RESOURCE + charge-grant modifier), with a Modern variant using the tag-only form.
Minimal proof-of-concept is just ONE row: a TypeTags entry adding `UNIT_CLASS_PROSPECTOR` to any
Modern-age unit surfaces the working Claim Resource command.

**Ring-4/5 via story-seeded resources (phase-2, researched 2026-07-03):** `EFFECT_PLOT_PLACE_RESOURCE`
lands on UNOWNED plots when driven from `COLLECTION_NARRATIVE_STORY` (13 base discovery stories do it),
and discovery sites spawn ≥3 tiles from major starts = exactly the ring-3–6 band; a custom tall-gated
discovery-investigation story can seed a Surveyor-claimable resource there, all data-only. Full system
writeup: [narrative-events.md](narrative-events.md).

## 6. The population/worker effects (data-only)

- **`EFFECT_UNIT_GRANT_UNASSIGNED_WORKERS` — LIVE, verified in-game 2026-08-15.** Grants unassigned
  population the player then places. Wire it the way the base game's single shipped use does
  (`GREATPERSON_ONE_SPECIALIST`, Al-Jazari, `age-exploration/data/greatpeople-gameeffects.xml`):
  `collection="COLLECTION_OWNER"`, `run-once` + `permanent`, one `Amount` argument, reached by a
  `GreatPersonIndividualActionModifiers` row with
  `AttachmentTargetType="GREAT_PERSON_ACTION_ATTACHMENT_TARGET_UNIT_GREATPERSON"`. Fires on the Great
  Person's Activate press. Pure GameEffects — no UIScript, no RPC, no desync exposure.
  **Scope:** the population arrives *unassigned* and is placed through the normal picker, so it feeds
  the settlement's existing tile set; it is a free-population lever, not a reach lever.
- ⛔ **`EFFECT_PLAYER_GRANT_UNASSIGNED_WORKERS` is a DEAD STRING** — binary-present, **zero uses in any
  base or DLC data**. A four-spelling argument sweep against it returned nothing, which proved only that
  the token has no handler. **Lesson worth generalising: before sweeping argument names on a
  binary-only token, check whether any shipped data uses it at all — and check for a sibling with a
  different scope prefix (`EFFECT_UNIT_…` vs `EFFECT_PLAYER_…`). The live twin was one grep away.**
- **Specialist unlock (Antiquity)** = tech node `NODE_TECH_AQ_CURRENCY`, which carries
  `MOD_AQ_SPECIALIST_CAP_INCREASE` (`EFFECT_CITY_ADJUST_WORKER_CAP` +1, `COLLECTION_PLAYER_CITIES`).
  Until a city's `Workers.getCityWorkerCap()` exceeds 0 there are no specialists at all, and
  `canStart(ASSIGN_WORKER)` returns false for **every** plot — a confound that will silently invalidate
  any early-game specialist probe.
- **`EFFECT_DISTRICT_ADJUST_WORKER_CAP` — LIVE, verified in-game 2026-08-15.** Per-district specialist
  capacity, `collection="COLLECTION_PLAYER_DISTRICTS"`, arg `Amount`, continuous (never `run-once`),
  delivered through the standard attach wrapper. Takes plot `SubjectRequirements`, so it can be
  targeted (base: `TRAIT_MOD_NEGARA_SPECIALIST_CAP_INCREASE`, coastal only). Unfiltered `Amount 2`
  took tiles from `Specialists 0/1` to `0/3`. ⚠ Read it from the **tile tooltip** — the City Details
  "allows N Specialist per Tile" line and `getCityWorkerCap()` are city-wide and ignore district
  bumps. ⚠ Does not open rural (see the box at the top).
- **`PlayerOperationTypes.ASSIGN_WORKER`** (`{ Location: plotIndex, Amount: 1 }`,
  `interface-mode-acquire-tile.ts`) is the specialist-placement RPC — plot-indexed, no city id, no range
  argument. The UI filters candidates through `PlotWorkersManager.workablePlotIndexes` *before* calling
  `canStart`, so a tile missing from the picker is not proof the native op refuses it.

**UI-isolate RPC route — 2026-07-10, and REVISED 2026-08-15 (see the box at the top — the orphan
problem is solved by claiming the tile first):** a shipping mod's
`<UIScripts>` file *can* write durable authoritative state via the sanctioned RPC
`Game.PlayerOperations.sendRequest(owner,"CREATE_ELEMENT",{Kind:"DISTRICT",Type:"DISTRICT_RURAL",
Location,Owner})` — verified to create a real Rural district + Farm that survives save/reload
(details: [ui-modding.md](ui-modding.md) section 6). On an **UNOWNED** tile the result is
**player-owned and orphaned** — no city banks it — because nothing UI-reachable folds an out-of-range
plot into a city's territory (`claimPlot` is gameplay-isolate only; `EXPAND`/`PURCHASE` are ring-3
capped). And `WorldBuilder.MapPlots.setOwnership` from a UIScript is inert/transient (no border, no
yield, no persistence).

⭐ **THE FIX, 2026-08-15: don't start from an unowned tile.** Let the **Surveyor's claim** fold the
tile into city territory first, then `CREATE_ELEMENT` onto it — the result attaches to the **city**,
not the player, and the city banks it. Orphaning was an artefact of the starting state, not a property
of the RPC.

Design rule worth carrying into any use of these mechanics: do NOT gate static-world effects
(appeal, wonder/terrain adjacency) behind per-Age tech/civic nodes — they would wrongly blink
off at Age rollovers; keep them binary and condition-gated. Yields are fine to re-gate/scale
per Age.
